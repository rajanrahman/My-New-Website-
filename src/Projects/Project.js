          This idea stemmed from the Co-Founder of Studi where he was at a cafe
          was trying to find somebody to study with. He told me about the idea
          of an app where people can find somebody to study with and I wanted to
          bring it to life. This is a just the FRONT END of the app where the
          BACK END will be developed using ASP.NET and MySQL.

          During my time at FreeFlows LLC, I was tasked to re-create the entire
          web application using React as the UI framework. I was given a Figma
          mockup on how to design the application and had freedom in designing
          the Mobile viewing. I further contributed to adding a custom music
          player where mp3s are grabbed from our Firebase database. The web
          application has a portal for producers to log into (unavailable in
          demo link).

          This is a full stack SPA application where users can log in/sign up,
          log their locations and a picture, and view other usersâ€™ locations as
          well. Using the Google Maps API, users can view the location on Google
          Maps. Relevant concepts include custom React Hooks, React Router Dom,
          React Context API, useReducer (Redux replacement), JWT for
          authorization and authentication in localStorage. Due to the nature of
          using the free tier of Heroku, images are not stored.

          Using the Clarifai API for face detection, this web application allows
          the user to upload a picture of someone and the app will draw a square
          indicating the face. The API gives me cooridnates which I used CSS to
          draw a retangle around the person's face. Go ahead and find a image
          link online to test out the app!
